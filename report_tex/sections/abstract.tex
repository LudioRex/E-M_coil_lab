\textbf{\textit{Abstract:}}
Electromagnetism is a key aspect of our lives. Today, practically all common household items have integrated electrical circuits. A common component in these circuits are electromagnets, whose functions range from the magnetrons in our microwave ovens to the launching systems of aircraft carriers. As such, a thorough understanding of electromagnetism is more important than ever, which is why we set out to compare the measured magnetic field of a current-carrying coil to that predicted by our best model of electromagnetism. Using a Pasco PS-2162 we measured the magnetic field strength along the coil's axis and found all data points to be within \SI{50.4}{\micro\tesla} of the expected values. Additionally, only 3 of the 13 analyzed data points were outside the uncertainty range. Our findings therefore support the validity of our current model of electricity and magnetism.
