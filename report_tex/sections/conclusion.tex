Our results support the validity of our current electromagnetic model, since most of our data points match the expected values. In fact, the largest difference between the theoretical and expected values was \SI{50.4}{\micro\tesla} and for the values outside of the uncertainty range, the furthest was only \SI{12.5}{\micro\tesla} from being within the uncertainty. The results of this experiment weren't particularly impressive, as plenty of electronic devices rely on this model of electromagnetism to function. Nonetheless, it is important to stay on the lookout for any discrepancies that might reveal a flawed understanding of electromagnetism, as it might lead to new innovation and to overall safer electronic devices.
